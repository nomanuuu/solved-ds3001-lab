For this assignment, you will implement the PageRank algorithm. Use Python version 3.

<strong>Part 0. Installing Python Libraries (optional) </strong>

You will may need to install python libraries. To manage your Python installations, we recommend pip. Pip is a tool for installing and keeping track of python packages. It is a replacement for easy_install which is included with python. It’s a bit smarter than easy_install, and gives better error messages, so you probably want to use it. You can install pip and the two packages we currently need by running these commands

&gt; easy_install pip

&gt; pip install -r reqs.pip

Then, you may install other Python libraries such as NumPy by typing ‘pip install numpy’ and nosetests by typing ‘pip install ‘pip install nose’.

<strong>Part 1. We provide the following files: </strong>

<ol start="5">

 <li>problem1~5.py – You will implement several functions containing a comment “INSERT YOUR CODE HERE”. Do not change the input and the output of the functions.</li>

 <li>test1~5.py – These files include unit tests. Run each file by typing ‘nosetests -v $filename$’ (e.g., nosetests – test1.py) in the terminal in order to check whether all of the functions are properly implemented. No modification is required.</li>

</ol>




Each number in the file name is corresponding each other. For example, test1.py contains unit tests of problem1.py.




problem1~4.py are mandatory assignment. problem5.py is bonus assignment (if you complete it you will get additional 30 points. i.e., 3% of your final grade).
